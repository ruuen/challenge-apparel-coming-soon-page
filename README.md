## My process

### Built with

- HTML / CSS
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SVG
- Mobile-first

### What I learned

This was a really fun challenge that reminded me how much I love CSS Grid. I do my best to use flexbox instead of grid for most things, but I really need to swap over to grid earlier sometimes to get a better responsive layout.

### Useful resources

- [.visually-hidden CSS class](https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com/blog/introduction-accessible-labeling) - This article helped with a `.visually-hidden` CSS class which visually hides elements but still allows them to be seen by screen readers. This class was used on the label for email address input to ensure screen readers are able to read this out, as only a placeholder was specified in the design.
